# ArchPi

This is an install guide for Arch Linux on a Raspberry Pi 2. It assumes you have another computer handy.

# What it does

It guides you though

* a) formatting a microsd card for use with the raspberry pi, and
* b) basic setup of the user account and installation of simple tools like

** vim
** tmux
** audio (through alsa)
** moc

It is strictly terminal based, but it's of course fairly simple to layer a full GUI on top (if you have the space).
